    `<article>
    <p>This is a cv-gen api. For start using you should:</p>
    <pre><code>
    1. Uncomment @Public directive in auth/users/users.controller.ts
    2. Add first user by using method post for api/users/
    3. Comment @Public directive to avoid unexpected access.
    4. Use your first user credentials for auth and add access token for access.
    5. Congratulate! Now you can use your user for access and add new user if necessary.
    </code></pre>
    <p><b>P.S.</b> This operation required to add the first user.</p>
    <p>You can add @Public directive for all controllers in development.</p>
    <p>But in production I suggest to delete @Public from protected controllers and use authorize guard inside API for protection</p>
    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <summary><b>Difference between scheme with Dto suffix and without it?</b></summary>
    <p>Scheme with Dto suffix used to pass data to the api. Dto is a 'data transfer object'. These schemas are using for POST and PATCH methods</p>
    <p>Schemes without Dto are outputs from GET methods</p>

    <summary><b>PUT vs PATCH?</b></summary>
    <p>I used PUT, because, we should update sub-collections like skills and ect.</p>
    <p>PATCH rewrite single fields and add additional data to collection. For instance, you can add new skills, but can't delete unnecessary!</p>
    <p>Note!!! Each PUT rewrite all data!</p>
